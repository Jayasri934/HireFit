README.md Template: AI-Powered Resume Analyzer
AI-Powered Resume Analyzer (HireFit Inspired)
An intelligent, full-stack application leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to screen resumes and provide job-seekers with an immediate ATS Compatibility Score and tailored feedback.

This tool aims to streamline the initial hiring phase by ensuring resumes are optimized for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and aligned with the target job description.

Key Features:
Real-time ATS Scoring: Calculates a precise match score between the uploaded resume and a specific job description using vectorization techniques.

Structured Data Extraction: Uses NLP to parse unstructured documents (PDF/DOCX) and extract key entities like skills, experience, and education.

Personalized Feedback: Provides actionable suggestions on missing or weak industry terms to close the gap between the resume and the job requirements.

User-Friendly Interface: A clean, intuitive web application for easy file upload and instant results display.

Technology Stack:
Language: Python

Web Framework: Flask

Core Libraries (AI/ML/NLP):

Scikit-learn (Sklearn): For implementing the vectorization and similarity logic (e.g., TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity).

Pandas & NumPy: For efficient data handling, cleaning, and numerical operations.

NLP Toolkits: NLTK / spaCy (or whichever you used for tokenization and parsing).

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (if used), Bootstrap/Flexbox (for responsive design).
